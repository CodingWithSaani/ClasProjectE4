How to Implement Recycler View in Android App.

----------------------------------------------
RecyclerView App
    a)Adapter -> RecyclerView.Adapter
    b)Adapter View ->RecyclerView


Step 1: We implemented the RecyclerView in xml file of our activity (activity_simple_room_imp.xml)
Step 2: Create a new xml file (rv_single_row.xml)
        This file will be used as model for our recycler view.
        We create 6 TextViews to display student id, student name and student email
        3 of TextViews will works as title
        3 of TextViews will works as data containers

Step 3: Create RVFiles packages
        This package will contain all the files related to our recyclerview.
Step 4: Create a new class with name RVCustomAdapter inside RVFiles package.
        PurposeOfThisFile: We used this file as Custom Adapter for our recyclerview.
        Step 4.1) Create an inner class with the name SingleRowViewHolder.
                  PurposeOfThisFile: We used this class as ViewHolder for our rv_single_row.xml file.
                  4.1.1 - We created a constructor with one view member(This view member basically hold the views inside our rv_single_row.xml)
                  4.1.2 - We inherited RecyclerView.ViewHolder(singleRow) inside our SingleRowViewHolder class.
        Step 4.2) We passed context variable and student list to constructor of our RVCustomAdapter class.
