ROOM Lib
 => Components
    1- Database
    2- Entity or Entities
        table(s)
    3- Data access objects
        DAO (CRUD) ->inserting some value, updating some value, deleting some value

    Example
    Step 1: We created three separate packages RoomDAO, RoomDb, RoomEntities
    Step 2: We created tables(Entities) of student and teacher
    Step 3: We created the DAO for student (CRUD)
    Step 4: We created out Database abstract class

    Step 1: we created a method in StudentDb class which will return
            StudentDao object
    Step 2: we created xml layout to get student id, name, and email
    Step 3: we created a view binding object to get all views of xml in kotlin file.
    Step 4: we create and initialized StudentDb object
    Step 5: we called the createDb() method inside onCreate() method.

    Important points:
    <> you will always get DAO object from the database class.
    <> Room does not allow queries to run on main thread.
